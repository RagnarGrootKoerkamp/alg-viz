#+title: Readme

This is a small app to visualize the extension step of the Ko-Aluru
linear-time suffix array construction algorithm:
Assuming the /small/ suffixes are already sorted and put and the end of their
first-character buckets, this shows how the remaining /large/ suffixes are put
into their places.

See my corresponding [[https://research.curiouscoding.nl/notes/suffix-array-construction/][note]] for more context.

*Usage*:

After installing Rust (see [[https://rustup.rs/]]), ~SDL2~, and ~SDL2_TTF~, clone
the repo and run
#+begin_src
cargo run -- [--save dir] [string]
#+end_src
e.g.
#+begin_src
cargo run BANANAS-APPLES
#+end_src

*Keyboard controls*:
- =SPACE=, =ESC=: go to next frame
- =Q=: go to last frame, or exit from last frame
- =X=: abort

*Animations*:

To turn a set of ~bmp~ images into a gif, use:
#+begin_src
ffmpeg -y -framerate 1 -i %d.bmp -filter_complex "split[s0][s1];[s0]palettegen=max_colors=64[p];[s1][p]paletteuse=dither=bayer",fps=1 suffix-array.gif
#+end_src
