#+title: Suffix Array & BWT visualizations

This is a small app to visualize some string algorithms.

* Ko-Aluru linear time suffix array construction

First, it visualises the extension step of the Ko-Aluru
linear-time suffix array construction algorithm:
Assuming the /small/ suffixes are already sorted and put and the end of their
first-character buckets, this shows how the remaining /large/ suffixes are put
into their places.

See my corresponding [[https://research.curiouscoding.nl/notes/suffix-array-construction/][blogpost]] for more context.

*Usage*:

After installing Rust (see [[https://rustup.rs/]]), ~SDL2~, and ~SDL2_TTF~, clone
the repository and run
#+begin_src
cargo run -- [--save dir] [string]
#+end_src
e.g.
#+begin_src
cargo run BANANAS-APPLES
#+end_src

*Keyboard controls*:
- =SPACE=, =ESC=: go to next frame
- =Q=: go to last frame, or exit from last frame
- =X=: abort

* Burrowsâ€“Wheeler transform & FM Index

The second visualization is of the BWT and FM index.
- First the rotations are listed and sorted.
- Then the last-to-first correspondence is shown.
- Then character counts and the occurrences array are computed.
- Lastly, it's shown how to compute the range starting with a given query.

*Usage*:

#+begin_src
cargo run --bin bwt -- [--save dir] [string] [--query <query>]
#+end_src
e.g.
#+begin_src
cargo run --bin bwt -- BANANAS-APPLES --query ANA
#+end_src

* Bidirectional Burrows-Wheeler transform

Lastly, you can visualize the bidirectional burrows wheeler transform.

This starts in the middle of a query and then first extends to the left, and
then extends to the right.

*Usage*:

#+begin_src
cargo run --bin bibwt -- [--save dir] [string] [--query <query>]
#+end_src
e.g.
#+begin_src
cargo run --bin bibwt -- BANANAS-APPLES --query ANA
#+end_src

* Animations

To turn a set of ~bmp~ images into a gif, use:
#+begin_src
ffmpeg -y -framerate 1 -i %d.bmp -filter_complex "split[s0][s1];[s0]palettegen=max_colors=64[p];[s1][p]paletteuse=dither=bayer",fps=1 suffix-array.gif
#+end_src
